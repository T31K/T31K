<p> Hello world! My name is Tim and I'm currently a freelance developer trying to transition into a full time dev. I'm also self taught, I have learned from many sources such as
Harvard's edX, r/LearnProgramming, Udemy, Stack Overflow and freeCodeCamp. I love learning and believe it is a life-long journey to continually improve upon oneself.
